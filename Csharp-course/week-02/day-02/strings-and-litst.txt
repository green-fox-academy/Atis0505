Strings
Strings are basic data structures, they can be treated like a list or array of characters.

Okay, you've made it this far. Awesome. If you feel you can get back to any remaining tasks you're unsure of from the previous days. If list is still not your friend, redo all (or some of) the tasks for arrays just with lists instead

// You can simply convert the examples from this
int[] example = { 1, 2, 3 };
// To this
List<int> converted = new List<int>  { 1, 2, 3 };
Only proceed to these if you're confident using lists, functions, loops, conditions

Dictionary
Dictionaries are key-value pairs. If you think of it, the list or array is also a dictionary, just with specifically integers as keys.

Find part of an integer
Find the substring in the list
