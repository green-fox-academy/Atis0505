Project Exercises
Draw fractals with recursive functions.

Acceptance criteria
Create and use classes (eg. Triangle, Circle, Line) with methods (eg. draw function with coordinates as parameters)
Experience points
Each fractal has a certain amount of experience points (XP) that can be earned by completing it
To level up and journey safely to the next week's challenges make sure you earn at least 2 XP
Tip: Copy the corresponding boilerplate from the drawing workshop.
Tip: Go with 4 XP if you're on insane difficulty setting.
Bonus XPs
make it multi-color for 1 XP
make the sizes slightly change randomly for 1 XP
make it animate for 4 XPs
