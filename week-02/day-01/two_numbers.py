# Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13
a = 22
b = 13
print("Added:" +str(a + b)+"\n")
# Print the result of 13 added to 22
print("Subtracted:"+str(a - b)+"\n")
# Print the result of 13 substracted from 22
print("Multiplied:"+str(a * b)+"\n")
# Print the result of 22 mutiplied by 13
print("Divided:"+str(a / b)+"\n")
# Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)
print("Dec:"+str(a / b)+"\n")
# Print the integer part of 22 divided by 13
print("Int part:"+str(a // b)+"\n")
# Print the reminder of 22 divided by 13
print("Reminder part:"+str(a % b)+"\n")
